            <h2>HTML200B - Lesson 10 Assignment</h2>
              <h3>Differences between HTML4 and HTML5</h3>
              <p>HTML is defined as Hyper Text Markup Language and has been the foundation of the World Wide Web since it was introduced to the Internet
              in the early 1990s. As a markup language, it is not regarded as a programming language but will be in the near future. As other languages
              it also has features, specifications and standards but changes with updates and a must for web developers and designers to understand.<br><br>
              In 1997, HTML version 4 became a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation and has been a standard web development for more than 10
              years. It has many core features of HTML but does not provide enough information when dealing with Web content. HTML4 is the earlier W3C
              standard for browser applications which doesn’t fully cater to the changing trends of the computing industry and with the dawn of smart-phones era.
              HTML version 5 is the current web standard being developed with intent to cop-up with new challenges in the web industry which is more flexible,
              robust and advanced as compare to its older counterpart. Below are some of the differences between the two.<br><br>
              The syntax in HTML5 is extremely clear and simple as compared to HTML4. An example of this is the DOCTYPE element at the top of every HTML
              document. In HTML4 the DOCTYPE declaration was lengthy and used to refer an external source. However in HTML5 DOCTYPE element has been made
              extremely simple. For instance a simple <code>DOCTYPE html</code> is enough to specify the document type. HTML5 also contains built in support for
              integrated multimedia files into web page via video and audio tags. In HTML4, the multimedia content was integrated in web pages via third party
              plugins such as Microsoft’s Silverlight and Adobe’s flash.<br><br>
              In HTML4, it was an extremely difficult task to get the geographical locations of visitors visiting a site and was even more difficult when the
              website was accessed through mobile devices. On the other hand, in HTML5, it is extremely easy to get the user location with HTML5’s Java Script
              Geolocation which can be pulled to identify the location of the user accessing the website.
              Client storage was an HTML benefit in order to store important data on client side browser’s which cache was used. However, that cache in HTML4
              was limited and doesn’t support relational storage mechanism. In HTML5, this issue has been addressed via Web SQL database and application cache
              that can be accessed via HTML5’s JavaScript interface.<br><br>
              In HTML4 the communication between the client and server was done through streaming and long requests, since there are no web sockets available
              in HTML4. On the contrary, HTML5 contains web sockets that allow full duplex communication between clients and servers.
              In HTML4, JavaScript and the browser interface with which user interacts, run in the same thread which affects performance. HTML5 contains JS
              Web Worker API which allows JavaScript and Browser interface to run in separate threads.
              As aforementioned, HTML4 is an established standard for developing browser applications and has been in use for more than 10 years. For this
              reason, HTML4 is compatible with almost all web-browsers. On the other hand, HTML5 is still in the process of development and the currently
              available tags are being modified and also new tags are being added. Therefore, HTML5 lags behind HTML4 in terms of compatibility with the
              browsers.
