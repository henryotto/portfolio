        <h1>About HPO</h1>
        <p>HPO stands for Henry Peter Otto, a student of HTML5 100 B Sp 17: HTML5 And CSS3 Foundations 2017 which Mr jeremy Flores is the main Instructor. <br>
          Mr Flores is a professional in Web Development, you can find His Github Projects <a href="https://github.com/jnf" target="_blank">here</a><br><br>
          In this first part of the course, we focused mainly on the foundations or basics of HTML5 and CSS3 but will dig in more details later. By attending, <br>
          I found that majority of students are interested and expecting JavaScript which is a more fun programming language/script.
          Unfortunately the basics will be offered on later classes.</p>
